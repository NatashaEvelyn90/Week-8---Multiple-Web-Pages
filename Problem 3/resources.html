    <p>Absolute paths would be when you are needing to reference an external website. For example, I linked the NASA website. So if there is a website that can explain information better or had a really great format, then that is what the absolute link would be. </p>
    <p>Relative links would be best when you just need to reference something within your own website or just to swap to a different page. </p>
